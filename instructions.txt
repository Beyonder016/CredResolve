Project Context

This folder contains data for the CredResolve – Next Best Action Intelligence Challenge.

The goal is to train a machine learning model that predicts the probability (TARGET) that a given suggested action will successfully recover payment from a borrower.

The final output must be a submission file with:

exactly 20000 rows

columns: id, TARGET

TARGET values between 0 and 1

Dataset Files Present

Core:

train.csv

test.csv

metaData.csv

sample_submission.csv

Interaction Logs:

whatsapp_activity.csv

teleco_call_back.csv (AI Voice Bot calls)

call_placed.csv (Human calls)

mobile_app_data.csv (Field visits)

AI_sms_callback.csv (SMS delivery logs)

All files must be joined using lead_code.

What You Must Build
1. Customer 360 Feature Table

Create one aggregated row per lead_code using all interaction logs.

WhatsApp (whatsapp_activity.csv)

Generate features:

count of messages sent

count delivered, read, failed

read rate

whether user ever responded

days since last read

AI Voice Bot (teleco_call_back.csv)

Generate:

total bot calls

answered count and answer rate

average and max call duration

days since last bot call

extract intent and sentiment from transcript_json

count of PTP intent

count of positive sentiment

Human Calls (call_placed.csv)

Generate:

total human calls

answered count and answer rate

average call duration

days since last human call

number of unique agents involved

Field Visits (mobile_app_data.csv)

Generate:

total visits

counts of results:

MET_CUSTOMER

DOOR_LOCKED

SHIFTED

days since last visit

SMS (AI_sms_callback.csv)

Generate:

total SMS count

delivered count

delivery rate

2. Static Borrower Features (metaData.csv)

Include:

total_due

log-transformed total_due

dpd_bucket

state

3. Training Dataset Construction

Merge Customer 360 features into train.csv and test.csv

Include suggested_action as a model feature

Handle missing values safely

Encode categorical variables properly

4. Model Training

Train a single probability prediction model

Use LightGBM or CatBoost

Use GroupKFold cross-validation with lead_code as group

Objective: predict probability of success (TARGET)

Ensure predictions are between 0 and 1

5. Prediction & Submission

Predict TARGET for all rows in test.csv

Create a submission file with:

id

TARGET

Ensure exactly 20000 rows

Save as submission.csv

Output Expectations

Code should be clean, readable, and runnable in Jupyter Notebook

Each step should be in separate logical blocks:

data loading

feature aggregation

merging

training

prediction

Avoid data leakage

Do NOT manually select or optimize actions

Only predict success probability for given suggested_action

Important Notes

You may assume all CSVs are in the same directory

Focus on correctness over heavy optimization

This is a learning-oriented, baseline-quality solution

Final Goal

Generate a working ML pipeline that produces a valid Kaggle submission file for this competition.
